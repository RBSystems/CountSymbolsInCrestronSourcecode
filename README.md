# Crestron Symbol Counter

Python 2.7 used

After I started to understand Crestron programming, I went to my manager with a 2-page printout of all the standard Crestron symbols and asked him to highlight all the symbols that were most frequently used -- which do I study first?

This program is something of a followup to that exercise. Now, parsing the code, I can see which symbols other programmers use the most often.

- Reads CMC, UMC and SMW source code. 
- Attempts to remove all device symbols from the output
- Parses by subdirectory and recursively parses everything located in that subdirectory

Some uses for this utility are:

- To show symbol usage and give some guidance on what a company or programming team considers the most important symbols
- To allow a Crestron programmer to compare symbol usage from one project to another or from a series of projects to another series, or one programmer vs. one or more different programmers, or from internal source code as compared to another code base like Crestron's CMC's or Crestron's Example Programs code.
-  To keep tabs on someone who goes wild with Truth Tables, for example.

It prints a listing out to DOS console but it also creates a CSV file that you can load into Excel, or another spreadsheet program, to do comparisons between code sets.
